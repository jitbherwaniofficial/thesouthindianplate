            Idli is a popular South Indian delicacy that is served as a staple
            breakfast item in South Indian households. It is loved for its
            light, fluffy texture & subtle delicious taste. Traditionally it is
            made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal and served with
            sambar and coconut chutney. This dish is cherished not only for its
            simplicity and ease of digestion but also for being a healthy,
            gluten-free option rich in protein and carbohydrates.
