        Meduvada is a traditional South Indian doughnut-shaped snack. It is
        also known as Urad Dal Vada. The crispy exterior and soft, fluffy
        interior is for what meduvada cherished. It is made from a batter of
        urad dal (black gram), which is soaked, ground, and seasoned with
        spices like cumin, black pepper, and curry leaves. This batter is
        then carved into doughnut shape and then deep-fried to get a golden
        and crispy exterior. Meduvada is often enjoyed as a breakfast item
        or snack and typically served with coconut chutney and sambar.
